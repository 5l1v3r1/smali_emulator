# Smali Emulator

This software will emulate a **smali** source file generated by apktool, it is intended to be used as a quick and dirty way to defeat various types of encryption and obfuscation while reversing an APK.

You'll find some examples in the `tests` folder of this project.

#### Note

This is highly experimental, a very small subsets of Dalvik opcodes are currently emulated, see the `smali/opcodes.py` file for more details.
